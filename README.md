Assesses   Learning Outcomes:       1,   2,   3   and   4
Relationship to   Programme Assessment Strategy
The   program's   learning outcomes are distinct yet   complementary,   ensuring that   no   overlap   occurs.   A   range of assessments, such as   academic   presentation   in   case of   Food   entrepreneurship   and   Business      Startup,   presentations,   reports and essays for other subjects,   offer   students   a   well-rounded   learning   experience.
The assessment   in the Food Entrepreneurship and   Business Start-Up   module   can   link   contextually with some components of the Sustainability, Social Responsibility, and Ethics   module   through   shared topics   like circularity   practices   in food   product   design and   business conceptualization.   Both assessments, though distinct   in format, allow students to   incorporate   sustainability   principles   into   the creation of their standalone   business concepts.   For example,   ideas   learned   about   reducing   waste   or ethical sourcing   can   be directly applied to   designing   business   models that   prioritize   environmental   responsibility and social   impact. This cross-pollination of   ideas   encourages   students to   develop   entrepreneurial ventures that are   not only   feasible   but also   can   potentially   align   with   sustainable   and ethical values   in the culinary   industry.
